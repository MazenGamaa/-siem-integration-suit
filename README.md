SIEM Tool Integration with Security Data Sources

This project demonstrates how to integrate a custom SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) setup with various threat intelligence and monitoring tools to enhance real-time detection, log analysis, and incident response capabilities.

üîç Project Description

This repository contains a collection of scripts, configurations, and documentation designed to:
	‚Ä¢	Integrate external threat intelligence sources into a SIEM pipeline
	‚Ä¢	Automate log enrichment using APIs (e.g., Shodan, AbuseIPDB)
	‚Ä¢	Analyze and correlate suspicious behavior across network events
	‚Ä¢	Improve alert fidelity and reduce false positives
	‚Ä¢	Provide a foundation for building a lightweight SOC monitoring tool

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
	‚Ä¢	SIEM: Elasticsearch, Kibana, or Splunk (configurable)
	‚Ä¢	Threat Intelligence APIs: AbuseIPDB, Shodan
	‚Ä¢	Scripting: Python
	‚Ä¢	Log Sources: Syslog, JSON-formatted event logs

üöÄ Getting Started
	1.	Clone the repository
	2.	Configure API keys in .env
	3.	Run the script: python enrich_logs.py
	4.	View enriched logs in your SIEM platform
